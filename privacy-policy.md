Your privacy is critically important to us. The core philosophy of our App is to be simple, useful, and respectful of your data.

### **Data Collection and Use**

The App is designed to function entirely on your device. All data you create within the App remains on your device.

To be perfectly clear:

- We do not collect your name, email address, or any other contact information.
- We do not track your location or usage habits.
- We do not have access to any of the reminders you create.
